## 🧩 API Modules Overview (What each module does)

Below is a high-level, **module-based** explanation of the main controllers and their responsibilities.

---

- **Manager**: operational access (catalog, booking, refunds, etc.)
- **Guest**: booking, search, feedback, cancellation requests

### ✅ MediatR + CQRS
All controllers delegate logic to:

- Commands (write)
- Handlers in the Application layer
